# challenge3


// For this challenge we had to make a Password Generator. For my project, I tried to make the generator have options for what kind of password you want generated. 
I wanted my generator to have color that's why I added neon glow on "Password Generator".
I made my generator fall themed, since fall is just around the corner.
